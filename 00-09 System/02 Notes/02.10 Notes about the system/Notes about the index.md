# Notes about the index

Index is a combination of what JD calls “One note per ID” and “One file for all your IDs”. [1]

The Obisidian plugin [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) builds a dynamic index, which gives a way to click through the index.

Indexes are built by creating one note per area/category/ID in the `00-09 System/00 Index`.
An ID has in its frontmatter defined where it belongs.

See [[ID template]] for details on how to set up frontmatter.
In [[00-09 System/00 Index/00.00 Index]] there is a `dataview` which dynamically creates a list of IDs, based on their metadata.
In each area/category/ID, you can then write notes about the scope of what lies underneath.

By entering metadata, a template can be used to auto-generate a list of notes. Again, by using `dataview`. See [[ID notes]].
